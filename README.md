#Hello again!

Cloning repos is second nature to you by now, to complete your coursework, please follow the instructions below:

- First create a new repo called ‘coursework’.
- The URL should look something like `git@github.com:yourusername/coursework.git`
- Create a new remote on this repo, call it 'coursework' too, to keep things simple.
- When that’s done, you need to create a local branch, you can call this branch whatever you want. (If you can’t think of a good name, use ‘listfix’)
- When you’re in this new branch, you need to take a look at the `show.md` file in the repo, and mark up the content as two lists, with headings.
- You need to use markdown to mark up the show.md file. If you don’t know, or don’t remember, the markdown syntax for a heading and list is used in this document.
- When done, merge your branch into master and push to the ‘coursework’ remote you added in step 3.
- Check your work!

Good luck!
